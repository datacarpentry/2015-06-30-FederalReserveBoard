## <a name="general"></a>General Information 

Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain.

Our curriculum includes:
* Day 1 morning: Data organization in spreadsheets and data cleaning with OpenRefine
* Day 1 afternoon: Introduction to R
* Day 2 morning: Data analysis and visualization in R
* Day 2 afternoon: Data management in SQL

The concepts, skills, and tools we teach are domain-independent, but example problem cases and datasets will be taken from organismal and evolutionary biology, biodiversity science, ecology, and environmental science.

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are required to bring their own laptops. (We will provide instructions on setting up the required software several days in advance) There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools.

### <a name="setup"></a>Setup and Software Installation

To participate in this Data Carpentry workshop, you will need working copies of the software described at the setup page. Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download the installers) before the start of your workshop. 

Instructors and helpers will be available starting at **8:30am** both days to help with any installation issues. Please bring your own laptop and power cord, and plan to come early if you do not have all the required software installed.

### <a name="surveys"></a>Workshop surveys

It's important for the instructors to know who the audience is for each workshop. To give us information about 
the participants for the workshop, please fill out a brief pre-workshop survey before the workshop.

You will also receive a post-workshop survey after the workshop so you can provide feedback and help us gauge the effectiveness of the materials.
